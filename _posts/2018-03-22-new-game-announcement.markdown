Hello to that *one* person who might be reading the blogs!
Today is the official starting day of our new project, [radiorun](https://github.com/vikinggames/radiorun), an open source infinite runner game.
Beta release will definitely be up by a week from now.
Until then, stay tuned for developer updates!
